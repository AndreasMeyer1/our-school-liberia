			"p1": "Most children in Liberia face some pretty immense challenges in going to school, if they get that chance at all. We're working to change that. For almost a decade now we’ve invested in giving a small number of Liberian children from all walks of life an unparalleled opportunity.",

One with not just pens and paper, but also chairs, lessons they can get excited about, and access to a toilet.",
			"p3": "If you’re like us and think that all children deserve that, help us keep making it a reality."
