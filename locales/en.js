			"p2": "You might be put off by the fact that we spend a lot more on each of our students than your average “development” sponsorship programs. We’re not. We know the cost of giving kids a real education. You know, the kind of education that enables you to read this website. One with not just pens and paper, but also chairs, lessons they can get excited about, and access to a toilet.",
			"p3": "If you’re like us and think that all children deserve that, help us keep making it a reality."

			"p1": "Our School Liberia, formally known as the Liberia Renaissance Education Complex, was established in 2006, in Duazon, Lower Margibi County, Liberia. We were the first school in this area, which is now home to an estimated 15,000 people.",
			"p2": "ABOUT LIBERIA",
			"p3": "Liberia was founded in 1847 by freed slaves from the United States. It lies on the West African coastline, nestled between Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Between 1989 and 2003 it suffered a devastating civil war, which saw more than 250,000 killed, tens of thousands internally displaced, and over 300,000 fleeing as refugees. More recently, it has been at the centre of the worst outbreak of Ebola that the world has ever seen.",
			"p4": "THE EDUCATION SYSTEM",
			"p5": "The war destroyed every sector of the country, including infrastructure, the economy and the education system. Even now, more than a decade later, illiteracy and unemployment rates remain among the worst in the world. With so many schools destroyed, the education system in Liberia is only just beginning to function again.",
			"p6": "During the war, many children were recruited as child soldiers and never saw the inside of a classroom. Instead they were socialized in the context of guns and drugs. Having missed out on an education, they were unable to get jobs, and without jobs, they are now struggling to educate their own children. It is often seen as more viable to send a child to work in the fields or selling at the local market, than to incur the costs of tuition, books and uniforms.",
